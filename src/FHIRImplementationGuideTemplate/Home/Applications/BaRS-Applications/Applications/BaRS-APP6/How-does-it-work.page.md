This section describes how the primary operations used in this application work. The following  diagrams illustrate the workflows and interactions of the following use cases :
* CAD to CAD Out of Area referral
* CAD to CAD Call Assist Request
* CAD to CAD Mutual Aid Request

This details a CAD to CAD Out of Area Referral:

Calls may be re-routed by the BT Emergency Call Service to an Ambulance Service Trust (AST) outside of the geographic area of the incident (the Call Receiving AST) for the following reasons:
* The BT Intelligent Routing Platform (IRP) re-routes the call if the AST in the geographic area of the incident (the Home AST) does not have sufficient Call Handlers to answer the call within a given time frame
    * The Home AST has a 'buddying' arrangement with an out-of-area AST to take their calls under defined circumstances (e.g. system downtime, periods of surge)
    * A third party caller calls about a patient in another area
    * Calls where the incident is on the boundary between two ASTs

Receive Call
- When a call is re-routed by BT Emergency Services, call details are also sent electronically to the Call Receiving AST's CAD via the Enhanced Information Service for Emergency Calls (EISEC) interface.

Create Case
- On receipt of this information the Call Receiving AST CAD creates a case that is subsequently further populated by system end users, the associated telephony system and other interfaced systems e.g. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) such as NHS Pathways and Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS).

Pre Triage Sieve
- On answering the call the Call Handler will undertake a Pre Triage Sieve (PTS) to facilitate the early identification of patients with a potentially life-threatening emergency, in order that immediate dispatch of an appropriate resource can take place at the earliest possible point in the call cycle.
    - If a life-threatening emergency is identified by the PTS the Call Receiving Trust may make a BaRS referral at this point in the call cycle, and all subsequent information will be communicated in BaRS Referral updates (see Sending a BaRS Referral)

Reason for Call
- The Call Handler will capture a Reason for Call based on what the patient or their representative tells them. This may also be known as 'What's the Problem text or the Presenting complaint.

Nature of Call (NOC)
- The Call Handler will capture a NOC code to facilitate the early identification of patients with a potentially life-threatening emergency.
    - If a life-threatening emergency is identified by the NOC the Call Receiving Trust may make a BaRS referral at this point in the call cycle, and all subsequent information will be communicated in BaRS Referral updates (see Sending a BaRS Referral)
    
Confirm Location
- The Call Handler will record the location of the incident and confirm using Gazetteer services. This is undertaken at the earliest opportunity and may be prior or subsequent to PTS and NOC.

Record demographics
- The Call Handler will capture the patient's baseline demographics where possible. This may be followed up by a Personal Demographics Service (PDS) search later in the call cycle.

Complete Triage
- The Receiving AST will complete a triage of the patient to determine the acuity of the case. This will typically be undertaken by a call handler on the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, using an approved Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) such as NHS Pathways or AMPDS.

Sending a BaRS Referral
- The Home AST is identified based on nationally agreed polygons that set geographic boundaries of responsibility for each AST. Service discovery will use these polygons to ascertain the ServiceID of the Home Trust.
- The Service ID is used to query the BaRS Endpoint Catalogue to identify the Home Trust's CAD system's endpoint details
- The Call Receiving AST will send the BaRS Referral to the Home AST, which includes information required by the Home AST to continue the patent's clinical care. This will also include the JourneyID created at the patient's first contact.
- The Home AST CAD will acknowledge the BaRS Referral on receipt


- Prior to making a Validation Request, the 999 AST will undertake a triage of the patient to determine the acuity of the case. This will typically be undertaken by a call handler on the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system, using an approved Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) such as NHS Pathways or AMPDS. For cases with an ambulance disposition, local business rules will be applied to determine if the case meets the requirement for validation by a CAS clinician. This will usually be Ambulance Response Programme (ARP) priority C3 and C4 cases, but may include C2 segmentation cases, subject to local agreements between the 999 AST and the CAS.
- For cases requiring clinical validation, a suitable CAS is identified based on the patientâ€™s clinical need and location. Service discovery will use local directories or UEC DOS to ascertain the ServiceID
- The Service ID is used to query the BaRS Endpoint Catalogue to identify the receiving CAS system's endpoint details.
- The 999-AST will send the Validation Request to the CAS, which includes information required by a CAS Clinician to continue the patent's clinical care. This will also include the JourneyID created at the patient's first contact.
- The CAS system will acknowledge the Validation Request on receipt.
- On receipt of the Acknowledgment (synchronous response), the 999 AST CAD may move the case to a 'pending' stack. If the case exceeds the validation breach time before a validation response is received, a fail-safe process should be implemented to ensure that an ambulance is dispatched within the time frame determined by the original triage outcome.
- If additional or changed information about the case is captured by the 999 AST subsequent to sending the Validation Request, but prior to receiving an Interim or Final Validation Response, they may send a Validation Request Update to ensure that the CAS has the most up to date information.
- If the 999 AST no longer requires the CAS to perform the validation, for example the patient calls back and the 999 AST decides to dispatch an ambulance, they may send a Cancellation.
- Prior to the CAS consultation the case will typically be posted to a queue on the CAS system for prioritisation, based on the validation breach time in the referral. This is determined locally or nationally from the triage outcome codes.
- The CAS Clinician will contact the patient, or their representative, utilising contact details in the referral message.
- On commencement of the consultation the CAS system sends an Interim Validation Response back to the Sending 999 AST to inform them that the validation activity is in progress.
- The CAS clinician undertakes a consultation to validate the Sending Service's triage outcome. The consultation will be informed by the clinical information sent by the requesting service. The outcome of the validation will be recorded in the CAS system.
- The outcome of the consultation under taken by the CAS clinician to validate the original 999 AST triage outcome, is sent to the Sending service in a Final Validation Response. This may include:
	* An outcome that requires an upgraded ambulance response from the Sending 999 AST
	* An outcome that requires an downgraded ambulance response from the Sending 999 AST
	* An outcome that requires an unchanged ambulance response from the Sending 999 AST
	* An outcome that can be met by the provision of care advice with or without an electronic prescription (Hear and Treat)
	* An outcome that can be met by the onward referral to another service provider e.g. ED
- On receipt of the Final Validation Response the 999 AST will update the case on the CAD and undertake the required action. This may include:
	* Moving the case from the pending stack to the dispatch stack and dispatching a resource within the timescales appropriate for the ARP Priority in the Final Validation Response.
	* Closing the case if an ambulance is not required.

To support the workflows for this application of the standard the operations that need to be supported are:

<hr>

## Make a Referral
??? LEIGH I COPIED PSEUDO CODE FROM APP3 - PLEASE CHECK AND UPDATE

Making a referral for this application follows the {{pagelink:Core-StandardPattern, text:standard pattern for BaRS operations}}.

The message definition that defines this payload for this application is: {{link:MessageDefinition-BARS-MessageDefinition-ServiceRequest-Request-Referral}}
<p>

In addition to that the specific workflow parameters that are required are as follows:

<div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box">
    <div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--border-grey">
        <div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box__content-box">

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>ServiceRequest (Status) = active</td>

                </tbody>
            </table>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>

Additionally the HTTP request header would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
```

The HTTP response header would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000001>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
```

### Cancel a Referral

To cancel a referral this application follows the {{pagelink:Core-StandardPattern, text:standard pattern for BaRS operations}} with an additional step. Before beginning the standard pattern as descbribed on the linked section, the referral **sender** must perform a read of the referral to be cancelled, from the referral **receiver**, prior to cancellation to ensure they are working with the most up-to date information and it has not already been actioned. This is done by performing a "GET ServiceRequest by ID" call to the **receiving** system's corresponding API endpoint (via the BaRS proxy).

The response to this request will be the requested ServiceRequest resource which should be checked for its current status to ensure it does not already have a status of "revoked" or "completed". If not, this version of the ServiceRequest should be used when re-submitting the modified resource in the POST bundle as described in the {{pagelink:core-standardpattern, text:standard pattern}}.

The message definition that defines this payload for this application is: {{link:messagedefinition-barsmessagedefinitionservicerequestrequestcancelled}}

As a general princple, when performing an update type of operation (of which cancellation is a special case), only the focus resource, any resources that are mandated due to contextual, linking or referential integrity reasons and any resources that include elements that are being changed, **should** be include. This is always defined within the relevent message definition.

If the update-to-cancel is taking place as part of a re-referral routine, once the cancellation is complete, the new referral message can be sent. This step in the workflow would follow the same process as 'Make a referral' detailed above.

In addition the specific workflow parameters that are required are as follows:

<div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box">
    <div class="nhsd-a-box nhsd-a-box--border-grey">
        <div class="nhsd-m-emphasis-box__content-box">

                        <th>Method</th>
                        <th>Payload Focus  </th>
                        <th>Status Required (MessageHeader, ServiceRequest, Encounter)</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>

                    <tr rowspan=3>
                        <td>
                            <b>All resources to include 'lastUpdated' value, under the meta section,</b>                    
                            <b>which must be a later timestamp, on updates, if the content of a particular resource contains updated info. Otherwise,</b>

NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}

The HTTP response header for the **GET ServiceRequest** would be:

```
X-Request-Id = <GUID_107>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_108>
```

the HTTP request header for the **POST $process-message** would be:

```
NHSD-Target-Identifier = {Receiver Service Identifier}
X-Request-Id = <GUID_000003>
X-Correlation-Id = <GUID_000002>
NHSD-End-User-Organisation = {FHIR Organisation (Base64 Encoded)}
NHSD-Requesting-Practitioner = {FHIR Practitioner (Base64 Encoded)} 
NHSD-Requesting-Software =  {FHIR Device (Base64 Encoded)}
